## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017, 2020, and 2023 to better understand:

1. What new job opportunities have emerged in the developer community over the years?
2. What factors about an individual contributed to salary?
3. How has the development landscape evolved with the rise of Artificial Intelligence in 2023?

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to show the work related to the above questions. The actual survey file for 2023 was large so to run the code correctly the file needs to be downloaded from the Stack Overflow [here](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/).

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@bassam.sb/the-ever-growing-field-of-data-science-is-it-still-worth-pursuing-1ebd052f9f20).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
